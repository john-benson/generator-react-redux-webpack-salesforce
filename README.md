# React Redux Webpack Salesforce generator
This is a fairly simple generator for a react redux webpack application with
hooks for Salesforce development.

If you want to update this project, please note that app/ is compiled
from src/ using babel (npm run build). This command naively assume the current
directory is the root of this project.
